The content of this document is related to TYPO3 CMS, a GNU/GPL CMS/Framework
available from `www.typo3.org <https://typo3.org/>`_

.. note::

   This extension was formerly titled "404 Page not found handling". As of
   version 4 we decided to re-title it to a less bulky "Error Handler for
   TYPO3", which also describes it more accurately. The extension key and the
   composer package name remain the same anyway.
