The content of this document is related to TYPO3, a GNU/GPL CMS/Framework
available from `typo3.org <http://typo3.org/>`_.

.. important::
   This version of the extension marks the start of the transition to the
   TYPO3 Site Handling (https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/Index.html)
   which is available since TYPO3 v9. While the new settings in
   :ref:`section-site-configuration` can be used as of now, the already known
   extension configuration remains still available. In the upcoming version 4 of
   this extension, only the new method will be kept. Note, that in TYPO3 v10,
   only the Site Configuration method will work!
